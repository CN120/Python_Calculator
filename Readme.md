## calc.py

This program is a small sample program to show my proficiency in python and use of the tkinter library. While building a calculator may seem simple, there are a few edge cases that make thing more complicated. I dont think that I covered all edge cases with this program, but this calculator does take into account stored values and I did my best to perform the most logical operation based on the pattern of buttons pushed. This includes being able to repeat the previous calculation by repeatedly pressing '=' button as well as having two stages of clear functionality: one to clear the display, the other to clear the memory/stored value. 

To run this program, tkinter is required to run the gui. This is included with the official release of python found on [python.org](python.org)
